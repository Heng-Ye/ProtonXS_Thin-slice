[step 1] Create the XS file based on an item changes in tems of the systematic uncertainties
-Generate reco XS file using 'make_ESlicedataXS.C'
 +Change the following items:
 +Output paths for xs file and xs plot: outpath, fout_path
 +Input data/MC reco sliceID files: fdata and fmc
 #Input MC validation files: fmc_valid
 #Output file name: fout
 **important xs histogram: gr_recoxs (reco xs produced given condition changes by systematic uncertainty items)


execute as: root -b -q make_ESlicedataXS.C

[step 2] Generate XS histograms w/o systematic uncertainties
-Simply edit I/O files
execute as: root -b -q make_SYSdataXS.C

[step3]
plot xs resuts w/o systematic uncertainties
execute as: root -b -q plot_xs_sys_uncertainties.C
